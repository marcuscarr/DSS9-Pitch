## Use for flowers and fruit

Black cherry trees are best known for their prolific flowering and their fruit.

Cherry blossom festivals in Japan are known worldwide, and a similar festival 
takes place in Washington, DC, every spring.

## Use for lumber

Cherry wood is often used in high-end wood furniture because of its appearance
and stability.

Harvesting a cherry tree for wood prevents its use for aestetic or food 
purposes, as tables have not been observed to produce flowers or fruit.

## Harvesting for wood

Naturally, if we are to harvest cherry trees for wood, we would want to 
harvest the trees that will yield the most wood. A data set is built into R
that reports the lumber yield, height, and girth for 31 black cherry trees.

```{r plot, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=3.7, fig.align='center'}

p <- ggplot(trees) + geom_point()

p1 <- p + aes(Height, Volume) + geom_smooth(method="lm")
p2 <- p + aes(Girth, Volume) + geom_smooth(method="lm") 

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)
```

Unsuprisingly, volume of lumber correlates strongly with girth (R^2 = 
`r format(summary(fit.girth)$r.squared, digits=2)`) and modestly with height 
(R^2 = `r format(summary(fit.height)$r.squared, digits=2)`), 
however the correlation is much stronger with girth. Height and girth are
weakly correlated (R^2 = 
`r format(summary(lm(Height~Girth, data=trees))$r.squared, digits = 2)`).

## Conclusions and future work

- Cherry tree lumber yield correlates strongly with girth
- Trees can be retained for aesthetic and food purposes by maximizing 
lumber yields.
- Further study is needed to determine whether tree beauty and fruit yields
are correlated with girth and height as well.
